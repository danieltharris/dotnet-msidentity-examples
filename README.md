# Purpose

This respository will contain examples of implementing various features of the Microsoft Identity Framework in a variety of .NET solutions. 
It is not intended to be useful for those learning how to implement these features in their .NET apps in a way that is functional, but should not be taken as best practice. Any feedback to improve or simplify the examples will be greatly received.

# Planned Examples

- Calling MS Graph _and_ an additional downstream API from the same Blazor app
- Signing in users to a .NET 8 Blazor Web App (Microsoft templates only include individual accounts out of the box for the new project type)
- Calling MS Graph from a background worker using delegated permissions
